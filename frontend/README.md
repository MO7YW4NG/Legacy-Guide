# Legacy Guide Frontend

This is the frontend for the Legacy Guide project, built with **Vite**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **shadcn-ui**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### Start the development server
```sh
npm run dev
```
- The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

---

## 🛠️ Build for Production
```sh
npm run build
```
- The production-ready static files will be output to the `dist/` directory.

### Preview the production build locally
```sh
npm run preview
```
- This serves the `dist/` directory locally, usually at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173).

---

## 🐳 Running with Docker

### Build the Docker image
```sh
docker build -t legacy-guide-frontend .
```

### Run the container
```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 legacy-guide-frontend
```
- The app will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### With Docker Compose
This project can be run as part of a multi-service stack. Example `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - backend
```
**Note:** Do **not** mount the frontend source as a volume in production, or the built files will be hidden and the app will return 404s.

## 📝 Project Structure
- `src/` — Main source code (React components, pages, hooks, etc.)
- `public/` — Static assets
- `dist/` — Production build output (generated by `npm run build`)

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) — Fast build tool
- [React](https://react.dev/) — UI library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) — Typed JavaScript
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) — UI components
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) — Utility-first CSS

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting
- If you see a 404 when running in Docker, make sure you are **not** mounting the frontend directory as a volume in Docker Compose.
- Ensure the build completes successfully and `dist/` contains `index.html` and assets.
